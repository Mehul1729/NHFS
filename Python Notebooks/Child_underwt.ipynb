    "According to [WHO](https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/302) , Child wasting refers to a child who is too thin for his or her height and is the result of recent rapid weight loss or the failure to gain weight. A child who is moderately or severely wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible. Child wasting is one of the World Health Assembly nutrition target indicators. \n",
